# acm-inspector

## Motivation
So you’re looking to:
1. know if your ACM cluster is healthy because you want to
    - upgrade your hub?
    - or rollout a new stacks of applications and configuration policies?
1. check if ACM hub can scale because: 
      - you want to deploy a bunch of new clusters
1. do capacity planning for future expansion

Well then you’ve come to the right place! We here aim to reveal, in a not so magical sort of way, the basic raw low level statistics about your current operating RHACM hub environment.  Why no magic?  Well we’re not quite there, yet, but see below for how you can contribute 🚀.  And why basic raw and low level? Well we think this speaks the language of a cluster administrator, a platform engineer, a DevOps SRE, the Operations team that needs to keep the lights on. We tried to convey the information in its purest form so as not to introduce a bias, and allow the domain knowledge to indicate which next steps to take.


## FAQ
1. **What is wrong with must-gather ?**
      - must-gather is great for what it does. The aim here is slightly different. But we are examining if this information can be collected automatically when must-gather is being run as well. After all, this information embellishes what is in must-gather. 
1. **Why not SLOs?**
      - Creating SLOs is orthogonal to this effort with some overlap. We do collect data here from metrics. But we collect lot of other data to inform us of what is happening. And the goal is here to ultimately `get inferences and recommendations automatically`. 
1. **Why not create dashboards out of this information?**
      - One of the explicit goals is not to drown the user/ourselves with data. It is very appealing to throw the 50 or so graphs and csv generated by the code into grafana. But if you notice - doing a little bit of feature engineering - we have tried to consolidate all relevant important data into one master.csv. Once this data is sent to us, we run adhoc analytics on that data to give our recommedations. If you have domain knowledge about ACM, you could use XL tricks to get to an answer as well - but it would be laborious and time consuming.
1. **What is left to contribute ?**      
      - A lot. This is mentioned in [Work-in-Progess section](#work-in-progress) as well:
      
      - You could contribute to gather some more of raw data. More of operator data needs to collected etc. There is data from search postgres DB etc that needs to be collected.
            
      -  You could help formalize the adhoc analytics that we run to give the recommedations. This is will be full off ACM domain knowledge. In other contribute to automatically draw `inferences` and `recommendations` from this data.
1. **Is Red Hat using this tool interally**      
      - Yes! We run this to gather data from our ACM perf-scale testing enviroment for analysis. We routinely tweak this repo based on experience of perf-scale and other complex customer cases.
      
## ACM Domain Knowledge

One of the main goals of this tool is to investigate around scaling ACM. Below is a causal diagram of ACM from standpoint of scalability. This is definitely `not a full complete ACM Causal diagram`. That would be much more complex. Let us take a moment to review this figure and get the key idea behind this.
![Causal Diagram describing ACM Scalability Model](/ACMScalabilityCausalDAG.png)

The big black dots are key drivers of ACM sizing along with the number of clusters it is managing. In other words, if we know the :
- Num of apps & policies (ie how many applications and policies are defined on the cluster) and this depends on the cluster size.
- Time series count (depends on how large the cluster is and what kind of work is running on them)
- Resoure count (depends on how large the cluster is and what kind of work is running on them)
ACM scaling model is `conditionally independent of the real cluster size`. Ofcourse the number of clusters is still important. You could appreciate that given this model, when we do real performance measurement, we can simulate/create a number of clusters with any size (could be kind cluster, could be Single Node OpenShift clusters) than clusters of specific sizes. It is much simpler to do the former instead of the latter.

So, to trace one line of the flow end to end:
`Num of apps & policies` drives the `API Server Object target count and size` which in turn drives load on the `ACM App & Policy Operators`. The `ACM App & Policy Operators` are also influenced by the `Cluster Count` - ie number of clusters - into which the applications and policies these have to be replicated to. These in turn creates resources on the `Kube API Server`. These resources are created in `etcd`. Therefore etcd health is one of the key drivers of `ACM Health`. And `etcd` health is also dependent on `Network health` and right `Disk health`.

## Work-in-Progress

This is very much work in progress. 
- As of now, the argument it supports is just `prom`. This stands for `in-cluster Prometheus on the Hub`. We will extend it to ACM Observability Thanos in the very near future. 
- We have begun by looking at a few key operators of RHACM and grabbing the health of those. 
- We have also gathered current snapshot of a few prometheus metrics to check the health of the containers, API Server, etcd. 
- We also gather current snapshot of Prometheus alerts firing on the Hub Server.
- We will continue to expand by looking at the entire set of RHACM operators (MCO, ManifestWork, Placement etc).
- The next few bold steps could be

      - recommending an action to solve the problem by drawing inference from the output. 
      - inferring if the current size of the Hub cluster can handle more managed clusters.
      - inferring a pattern of usage of the Hub from which we could infer a new Hub size if the number of managed clusters increased from say x to 10x (10 to 300)

## Note

Connection to in-cluster Prometheus works from OCP 4.10 upwards. That is because of route changes in open-shift-monitoring namespace.

## To run this using your own python env
This has been tested using python 3.9.12. But if you do not want the hassle of setting this all up, use the Docker method.

- clone this git repo
- cd src/supervisor
- connect to your OpenShift cluster that runs RHACM by `oc login`. You will need a kubeadmin access.
- install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - can be pip3 instead of pip depending on your python configuration. That is one more reason to use the docker container
- run `python entry.py prom`
  - (same disclaimer.. on my Mac (which is probably not configured well for python)) I used: `python3.11 entry.py prom`
- `if you` run `python entry.py prom 2>&1 | tee ../../output/report.txt` then all the output on the screen will also be redirected to `output/report.txt` file.

## Using Docker
1. To Build
      ```
      docker build -t acm-inspector .
      ```
1. Or if you cannot build, you can simply download the image and make it locally available.
      ```
      docker pull quay.io/bjoydeep/acm-inspector:latest
      ```      
1. To Debug
      ```
      docker run -it acm-inspector /bin/sh
      ```
1. To Run
      ```
      docker run -e OC_CLUSTER_URL=https://api.xxx.com:6443 -e OC_TOKEN=sha256~xyz -v /tmp:/acm-inspector/output quay.io/bjoydeep/acm-inspector
      ```
      _Note: The image name needs to be changed from `quay.io/bjoydeep/acm-inspector` to `acm-inspector` if you are using the local docker build. And the volume (-v) points to `/tmp` for local machine. This should/could be changed depending on your need._


### Result

1. `Historical` metric results are created as png & csv files under `output` directory
      - There is `output/breakdown` directory which contains detailed png & csv files containing breakdown metrics for example by namespace or resource etc
      - Under the `output` directory all png & csv files contain metrics are grouped by time `only`
      - This allows us to merge all metrics under a csv called `master.csv` and to create a set of graphs (png) that start with the name `master-*.png`. These visually correlate how the system is performing with time as the number of managed clusters gets added. 
2. The `master.csv` has metrics that corresponding to almost each of the descendants of the big black dots. If some are missing, they should be added - and you can help! Let us take a look at what is there now.

      |Node|Metrics collected|
      |---|---|
      |API Server Object target count and size|Yes on count|
      |ACM App & Policy Operators|Yes|
      |ACM API|Need to be added - but should be same as API Server|
      |Kube  API Server|Yes|
      |etcd|Yes|
      |etcd-Disk|Yes|
      |etcd-Network|Yes|
      |MCO Health|Yes|
      |Thanos health|Yes|
      |Obs Health|Can be inferred|
      |Obs API Health|To be added|
      |Indexer|Yes|
      |Postgres|Yes|
      |Search Health|Can be inferred|
      |Search API|Need to be added|
      |ACM Health|Can be inferred|
      |Cluster Count|Yes|
      |Num of apps & policies|Yes|
      |Time Series Count|Yes|
      |Kubernetes Resource Count|Yes|

3. `Current` data is printed out in the screen as below:

Note: `True` in the ouput means good status (*though this is not fully working yet*).
